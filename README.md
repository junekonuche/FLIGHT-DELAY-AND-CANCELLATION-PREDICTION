# FLIGHT-DELAY-AND-CANCELLATION-PREDICTION

 Project Overview

Flight delays and cancellations are major issues in the aviation industry, affecting passengers, airlines, and overall operations.
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a flight will be delayed or cancelled before takeoff based on flight-related and weather features.

 Objectives

Predict the likelihood of a flight being delayed or cancelled.

Identify key factors influencing flight delays.

Compare the performance of multiple ML models to determine the best one.

 Dataset

Dataset Source: Kaggle – Flight Delay Prediction Dataset

Features include:

Airline

Origin & Destination Airport

Scheduled Departure Time

Day of Week / Month

Weather Conditions

Flight Distance

Delay Status (Target Variable)

 
  Model Evaluation

Each model is compared using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC Curve / AUC

The best-performing model is selected based on balanced performance across these metrics.

 Key Insights (What is Expected)

Weather, departure time, and airline type strongly influence delay probability.

Morning flights tend to have fewer delays compared to evening flights.

Ensemble methods (like Random Forest) are likely to outperform single models.


Advanced ensemble & deep learning models

Feature explainability (e.g., SHAP)
